        <p><h2>KTX - JSX for Kotlin</h2>
<p>Kotlin's HTML DSLs are extremely nice. But when writing UIs for the web, people are used to HTML. Not being able to use HTML directly in the code like JSX or TSX offers, is a serious drawback for a lot of people. So I tried to find a way to offer it in Kotlin JS, so that for example React can be used more similar to as it is in Javascript projects.</p>
<p>This is what I enabled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin"> val CustomButton = KtxFC&lt;Props&gt;(&quot;CustomButton&quot;) {
     val (count, setCount) = useState(0)

     ktx(&quot;&lt;button onClick=${{ setCount(count + 1) }}&gt;$count&lt;/button&gt;&quot;) ()
 }
 external interface HelloProps : Props {
     var name: String
 }
 val Hello = KtxFC&lt;HelloProps&gt;(&quot;Hello&quot;) { props -&gt;
     ktx(&quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello ${props.name}!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;CustomButton /&gt;&lt;CustomButton /&gt;&lt;CustomButton /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;) ()
 }


fun main() {
    createRoot(document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0]).render(
        ktx(&quot;&lt;Hello name='you'&gt;&quot;).create()
    )
}
</code></pre>
<h3>How it's done</h3>
<p>Work is based on the excellent <a href="https://github.com/ExoQuery/Terpal">Terpal compiler plugin</a> that allows you to have advanced string interpolation in Kotlin. It gives you a way to override the default behaviour of string interpolation - for example when you have a String <code>&quot;a + b = $c&quot;</code>, then you can implement an interpolator function that receives parameters for the string parts and the actual instances of the parameters you pass in. Afterwards, you can use it like <code>myInterpolator(&quot;a + b = $c&quot;)</code>. It opens the door to just embed raw HTML into your code as string, while being able to pass in callbacks and other properties just like into any kotlin DSL.</p>
<p>Okay, now the heavy part. Just like the JSX compiler, you need to process that input somehow. I do it in the interpolator, where you implement a function of the signature</p>
<p><code>override fun interpolate(parts: () -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;, params: () -&gt; List&lt;Any&gt;) = FC&lt;Props&gt; {</code></p>
<p>As you can see, it returns an <code>FC&lt;Prop&gt;</code>, which is Kotlin's official wrapper for React function components. In order to get to that from a bunch of strings and some params, we nead heavy machinery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  Of course I am not able to implement a fully functional solution, I can only do some proof of concept that is nowhere near production usability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I started, I implemented a small parser and just parsed the HTML string basically char by char. That's very tedious, and took too much time, so I switched to using what the dom api already offers out of the box:</p>
<p><code>val currentSnippet = web.dom.parsing.DOMParser().parseFromString(completeString, DOMParserSupportedType.textXml)</code></p>
<p>But for that to work, we need to feed in actually valid HTML, which our string parts definitly aren't, remember, all our parameters are missing, they are not yet stirngs but still objects.</p>
<p>So I used a quick hack and replaced different types of properties like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">parts().forEachIndexed { index, part -&gt;
    completeString += part

    if(index &lt; params.size) {
        when(val param = params[index]) {
            is String -&gt; completeString += param
            is Int -&gt; completeString += param
            is KFunction&lt;*&gt; -&gt; completeString += &quot;\&quot;\&quot;&quot;
            // TODO: Support more types
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This naive way will surely hit limitations, but for the example it works.</p>
<p>We can then recursively handle all elements.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">currentSnippet.children.iterator().forEach { child -&gt;
    handleChild(child, params)
}
</code></pre>
<p>While the handle method is</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun ChildrenBuilder.handleChild(child: Element, params: List&lt;Any&gt;) {
    // React/JSX convention has custom components always be uppercase
    val tagIsLowerCase = child.tagName.lowercase() == child.tagName
    if (tagIsLowerCase) {
        if (child.tagName == &quot;button&quot;) {
            val onClickOrNull = params.firstOrNull()

            button {
                onClickOrNull?.let { _onClick -&gt;
                    onClick = {
                        (_onClick.unsafeCast&lt;() -&gt; Unit&gt;())()
                    }
                }
                +child.textContent
            }
        } else {
            IntrinsicType&lt;PropsWithClassName&gt;(child.tagName)() {
                // TODO: Passing an empty list is not appropriate here, we need to find out
                // the list of attributes that go to the child
                val hasAnyChildren = handleChildren(child, emptyList())
                if (!hasAnyChildren) {
                    +child.textContent
                }
            }
        }
    } else {
        val element = globalThis[child.tagName]
        ((element.unsafeCast&lt;IntrinsicType&lt;PropsWithClassName&gt;&gt;()) {
            child.attributes.iterator().forEach { attribute -&gt;
                this.asDynamic()[attribute.name] = (attribute.value)
            }
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, not code to be proud of for multiple reasons. First, it leaves open a lot of edge cases. Would take time to implement a fully functional version. Second, the differentation should only be between custom and standard tags. For <em>button</em>, I added a branch because it let me easily support passing and using onClick handler without having a better implementation of the parameter stuff I mentioned above. Then, the whole project abuses the Kotlin react wrapper DSL. As you can see, it's not intended to be used in an abstract way, but rather to just write simple react comopnents. Using the DSL for higher order prposes is a PITA and it took me some time to figure out how it works.</p>
<p>But you get the idea. It works. And as long as we produce valid Kotlin react wrapper objects, live is not too bad.</p>
<h3>Already known problems</h3>
<h4>I can't hide the react dsl</h4>
<p>Noticed how the result of the <code>ktx</code> function call needs to be applied once again? That's because the function returns a functional component and that one needs to be called in the function body that is the function that builds your function component. Wait, whoot? Yes. It's brainfuck. You need to read it multiple times in order to understand it. I could easily hide that wart behind a wrapper extension function and it would be completely invisble, but I experienced some issue with the Terpal compiler plugin, so was not able to pull it off.</p>
<h4>Can't use delegated properties</h4>
<p>Instead of <code>val CustomButton = KtxFC&lt;Props&gt;(&quot;CustomButton&quot;) { }</code> I could normally easily provide possibility to do <code>val CustomButton by KtxFC&lt;Props&gt; { }</code> so that one doesn't need to redefine the name of the tag, as well as have it automatically block the identifier for the scope and give a compiler warning. In Kotlin JS, there seems to be an issue with property delegation providers, it just didn't work for me.</p>
<h4>It's not a compiler</h4>
<p>Good news: You don't need the hell of brittle tools that you need in Javscript projects to pull of JSX. Bad news one: We're not directly embedding HTML syntax in our programming language, so this is not a fair comparison and we would need to pull of a solution with Javascript custom string literals. Yes, Javascript can do that, officially, without compiler plugins, 1 : 0 for Javascript. Bad news two: we're doing eveything at runtime, not at compile time (Only the transformation from regular string interpolation with custom interpolator functions is actually done at compile time). That means it will cost you resources at runtime. I have no idea how much, I haven't looked at it.</p>
<h2>Closing words</h2>
<p>I know React is popular, but there's also <strong><a href="https://lit.dev/docs/">Lit</a></strong> which could probably get resembled in Kotlin with a string interpolation compiler plugin much easier than React. Maybe in the future I can take a closer look at Lit and try something similar than I just did with the react wrapper. TBH I don't really think there is a chance a JSX-like solution is able to get to the production readiness people expect when they use anything related to React - not matter if Kotlin or Javascript or Typescript.</p>
