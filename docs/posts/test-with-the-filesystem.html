    </header>
            <p><p>The last post already motivated why we should move away from unit tests and do developer tests instead. One particularly interesting characteristic that is commonly demanded for those former unit tests is: &quot;They don't do IO. When they do IO, they are interation tests&quot; I was told too often in the past. And using filesystems is IO too.</p>
<p>Let's dissect.</p>
<p>So first of all, &quot;not doing IO&quot; is <strong>not a goal</strong>, not an intention. It's a <strong>measure</strong> to fulfill one ore more intentions. We developers don't like being told <em>how</em> to do things, we only want to know what goal should be achieved and find the best way ourselves, right? So let's talk about the <em>what</em> first.</p>
<p>The intentions behind the no-IO-rule are (based on countless discussions I had over the years and what I was able to read in a lot of sources touching the topic testing):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Isolation.</strong> This is ony of the most misunderstood criteria of tests, especially unit tests. Too many people told me that a unit must be tested in isolation, therefore, all dependencies must be exchanged with test doubles. The truth is, isolation should be achieved for the test, not the unit. The test should run in isolation, so that tests can run in parallel. They can't, if they use shared mutable state. They would interfere. So the goal is: <strong>Tests should not interfere with each other.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Speed.</strong> The faster tests are, the better. I know, deep. So the goal is: <strong>Tests should be fast.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Independent.</strong> A test should only depend on a single thing, should have only <strong>one reason to fail</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable.</strong> A test should have the same result, every time, should not rely on any uncontrollable parameter.</li>
</ol>
<p>And now let's elaborate, step after step.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong> is completely unrelated to filesystem usage, as long as we ensure that no test uses another tests' files. That's perfectly possible. The only thing that's needed is a configurable file path as a base folder for the functionality of your main code that uses the filesystem. I never encountered any case, where that's not possible, so I will just pretend it does happen extremely rarely. And if it does, in your own code, it's probably easily adjustable, right? Having that said, decent test frameworks let you use real temp folders effortlessly, for example in JUnit 5, you can just make up a test function parameter, add @TempDir on it and done, look <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.9.1/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/io/TempDir.html">here</a>. I am sure other platforms worth using provide similar functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Speed.</strong> First of all: What expectations towards speed of a test do you have? And <em>why</em> do you have them. Is there any real reason, any benefit for you in fast tests? Does it matter whether its 2 or 20 ms? Have you ever <em>really</em> thought about what it costs you when you introduce mocks and whether those are worth the speed gains? Have you ever measured whether they're faster at all? I have bad news. I implemented a simple test that lists 10 files in a given directory (in kotlin). <em>12 ms on a real filesystem, 61ms with a virtual filesystem (Jimfs) and a whopping 740ms when mocking it (mockk).</em> Of course, there might be other libraries, other programming languages etc giving different results, but my point is: People are way too convinced that mocking the fs will be faster. But maybe it isn't at all or not by any meaningful margin.</li>
<li><strong>Independence</strong> is an interesting one. Running code depends on so many things. You could run out of main memory, you can have bit flips because of lunatic radiation, an agent could prevent you from calling certain methods, yet no one would seriously talk about that when asking why a test fails, right? So depending only on one thing and failing for one (relevant, identifiable?) reason is not the same thing. When your code uses the filesystem, the dependency to that filesystem is just simply there. It doesn't vanish because you want it to. And only because the filesystem interface implementation hides possible failures by using exceptions that are not part of its function signatures, doesn't mean your code doesn't need to handle it. Handle it, propagate it properly and the failure will be easily identifiable when it happens. Furthermore, an error is just like any other part of the context: Properly setup, your tests don't need to worry, because it never happens. What are those failures we are talking about? No space left on device? Use temp files and clean up and you'll be fine, those 10Mb disk space won't make you poor. No permissions to write? Let your test process create the folder and you are fine. Those theoretical issues you could have with the filesystem are 99% of the time just that: theoretical. Used to win an argument. Let's be better than that and only use those arguments if they are <em>actually</em> relevant for our context and we can afford them.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatability</strong> is also interesting. What exactly is not repeatable when using a filesystem? The potential errors we discussed in point 3? The exact timestamps of files? Whatever is not exactly repeatable when using a filesystem, is simply irrelevant for testing. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't use mocking when you can't reproduce certain states in other ways, like specific timestamps or so. It's appropriate then.</li>
</ol>
<p>So none of the given goals imply that faking the filesystem is necessary.</p>
<p>Over to another interesting topic. What about the other criteria that make for a good test? What about the costs of faking the filesystem just to be &quot;better&quot; at the above points?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Library dependency</strong>. The virtual filesystem I used for the benchmarking above came with some additional drawbacks, for example it doesn't play well anymore with kotlin's extensions on the JDK file types and compiles, only to throw some UnsupportedOperation exceptions at runtime. A problem that you will never ever have with the real file api. But problems you will likely have with other libraries and language ecosystems that are probably even less mature then Java and the JVM. At least you will need a decent mocking library most times, but granted, it might be already an existing dependency, so no big deal. Other than that, simply a cost to consider.</li>
<li><strong>Test induced damage</strong>. When the aspects in the previous point ruled out retroactive mocking of the filesystem, you need to change your code design, maybe add some indirection interfaces, change from official filesystem types to some adapter types etc. Those inflicted changes are drawbacks, costs, that you need to consider.</li>
<li><strong>Tests as documentation</strong> is one of the first things that goes downhill when mocking is introduced. Not necessarily the biggest deal, because it could also be written in better ways, but undoubtly the normal std api surfaces are better readable. Ever mocked a file system state that involves folders, so multiple levels? So much fun to read that code from others. Not.</li>
<li><strong>Wrong implementations</strong> can sneak into your code base, giving you false confidence. Happens when your mocks don't reflect the real implementation. Is simply a risk to consider.</li>
<li><strong>Accidental coupling</strong> is created between your mocks and the implementation of the filesystem. This might not be too relevant, because a) it's always the case when you mock and you might not see it as accidental and b) because filesystem apis are pretty stable most times. Depending on the complexity of the filesystem however, the coupling could again become more problematic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding those aspects, let's take a look at how tests potentially look like and what we can learn from it.</p>
<p>The mock test is &quot;fantastic&quot;, look at it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Test
fun listTenFiles() {
    val topLevelFolder = mockk&lt;File&gt; {
        every { list() } returns arrayOf(
            &quot;0.txt&quot;,
            &quot;1.txt&quot;,
            &quot;2.txt&quot;,
            &quot;3.txt&quot;,
            &quot;4.txt&quot;,
            &quot;5.txt&quot;,
            &quot;6.txt&quot;,
            &quot;7.txt&quot;,
            &quot;8.txt&quot;,
            &quot;9.txt&quot;,
        )
    }
    assertThat(
        topLevelFolder.list().toList()
    ).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(
        &quot;0.txt&quot;,
        &quot;1.txt&quot;,
        &quot;2.txt&quot;,
        &quot;3.txt&quot;,
        &quot;4.txt&quot;,
        &quot;5.txt&quot;,
        &quot;6.txt&quot;,
        &quot;7.txt&quot;,
        &quot;8.txt&quot;,
        &quot;9.txt&quot;,
    )
}
</code></pre>
<p>So many subtleties here. Do you smell the self-fulfilling prophecy here? This test is not worth a dime anymore, it doesn't use any real implementations anymore. Furthermore, I implemented it as the first test and guess what, of course instead of returning the file names, I returned the fullpaths and asserted for exactly that, only to find out that it was wrong when I implemented the test with the real filesystem. Or the &quot;in any order&quot; part. Sure, if you're using file api daily you might remember that list() doesn't guarantee any order. But the more common situation will be, that someone doesn't know or remember it and will add a very nasty bug with that in your code that you will curse over some day. Keep in mind that I left out the class using the code for brevity here.</p>
<p>Question your beliefs about performance and keep in mind what might be more relevant: Confidence in your test by using the real implementation and simplicity.</p>
<p>The test against real filesystem looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>@Test
fun listTenFiles(@TempDir tempDir: File) {
    val topLevelFolder = tempDir.resolve(&quot;toplevelfolder&quot;).apply {
        mkdirs()
    }
    repeat(10) {
        Assertions.assertTrue(
            topLevelFolder.resolve(&quot;$it.txt&quot;).createNewFile()
        )
    }

    assertThat(
        topLevelFolder.list().toList()
    ).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(
        &quot;0.txt&quot;,
        &quot;1.txt&quot;,
        &quot;2.txt&quot;,
        &quot;3.txt&quot;,
        &quot;4.txt&quot;,
        &quot;5.txt&quot;,
        &quot;6.txt&quot;,
        &quot;7.txt&quot;,
        &quot;8.txt&quot;,
        &quot;9.txt&quot;,
    )
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which is just the most simple code you could write and anyone who is not completely new to the used language will not have any problems understanding it (allthough in the given case the mock version also doesn't look to magical, which is not my normal of those tests).</p>
<h2>Closing words</h2>
<p>I recommend <strong>using the real filesystem by default</strong>, ditch the term unit test and accept that it's okay for a developer test to use the real filesystem. Not only ok, but simply better except for very rare cases.</p>
<p>Those cases could be the need to handle insanely large files, specific metadata, simulation of failures or verifications that the filesystem is not touched by another piece of code.</p>
