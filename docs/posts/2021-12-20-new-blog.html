        <p><h2>Good old times</h2>
<p>It was nearly <a href="https://hannomalie.github.io/posts/2012-06-12-ssao.html">a decade ago</a> when I first felt that I might need to write about the cool experiments I do on a blog or otherwise I will forget that they ever happened. And <a href="https://hannosprogrammingblog.blogspot.com/">blogger</a> served me well, but using its wysiwyg editor for code wasn't a pleasure - and I had plenty of code to share over the years! For this reason, my old blog posts contain a colored bunch of different ways of formatted code: Manually generated html-css-mixes from pages like hilite.me (which is especially bad when you have to alter the code again while writing), kotlin playground embeds, github gists, italic text ... screenshots? I hope not. It was time to have something better.</p>
<h2>Too many options</h2>
<p>Lord, there are so many static site generators, everyone claims to be better than the previous one. I won't try to objectively justify why I dimissed all of them, but I was certain I didn't have a good experience in the past with JavaScript, Ruby, Python or Go ecosystems, as there always was a massive amount of fiddling with local setups, paths and dependency, tool or operating system issues. To be exhaustive, I also made negative experience with Orchid, a static site generator written in Java.</p>
<p>And then, there is always that one ages old JVM library that does what you need and is stable. In this case, it's <a href="https://www.jbake.org">JBake</a>. Take a look at the comperatively short and sober <a href="https://jbake.org/docs/2.6.6/">documentation</a> that doesn't even try to be fancy. It's dead simple: You have content, you have templates, they get rendered, done. Would they leave out the bloated chapter 9.1, the documentation would be two thirds long.</p>
<p>And do you know what's the best? It's a JVM dependency. Which means besides using a precompiled executable, you can just use the dependency in whatever JVM execution environment you like. I am hinting at Gradle here. Gradle is best for automating any workflow you can imagine. But step by step, let's take a look how to use Gradle and JBake to create a blog in a future post.</p>
<p>Now I just want to state that I imported all posts from my old blog without content-related changes and did my best to keep the format in shape. Some needed to be translated, some links needed to be fixed.</p>
<p>And now, enjoy the new blog with me :)</p>
