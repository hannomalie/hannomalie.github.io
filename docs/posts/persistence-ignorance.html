        <h1>The problem with persistence ignorance</h1>
        <p></p>
    </header>
            <p><h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>A word or warning. I didn't manage to get this post as structured, easy to read, objective as I would have whished. This really turned out to be more of an opinion than anything else. Over the years I had a hard time accepting the dominance of the <em>&quot;I don't care about the implementation details&quot;</em> mentality that is behind <em>persistence ignorance</em>. In my experience it didn't do too much good but caused a lot of friction that would not have been necessary with a more balancecd mindset. Persistence is and will ever be a sepcial topic that comes with a lot of challanges and I don't think pretending it doesn't helps. Here you can read about some experiences and thoughts on the topic.</p>
<h2>On persistence ignorance</h2>
<p>Domain driven design had a huge impact on many of the projects I worked on over the last decade. In the past, <a href="https://hannomalie.github.io/posts/the-ddd-controversy.html">I have written about DDD</a> already. In essence, the idea to closely collaborate with domain experts is one of the biggest benefits of the approach. Techniques like event storming can also be very helpful to get a first order into chaos. However, I consider tactical design as waste and strategic design only rarely helpful. Not only DDD but also other practices like hexagonal architecture and others have one thing in common. Something that became ubiquitous, something that became the default in most of the projects I worked on:</p>
<p>They motivate that you <strong>only care about the domain and not about any technical details</strong>.</p>
<p>And they are very clear about it. Let's take an excerpt from one of my absolute favourite books, <em>Domain Modeling made functional</em>, <em>Chapter 2: Understanding the domain - Fighting the Impulse to do Database-Driven Design</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you do this, you are making a mistake. In domain-driven-design we let the domain drive the design, not the database schema. It's better to work from the domain and to model it without respect to any particular storage implementation. After all, in a real-world, paper based system, there is no database. The concept of a &quot;database&quot; is certainly not part of the ubiquitous language. The users do not care about how data is persisted. [...] Why is this important? Well, if you design from the database point of view all the time, you often end up distorting the design to fit a database model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My complain about the advice above is that it is <strong>too one-sided</strong>. Of course, when a book is about <em>domain modeling</em>, it will probably advice to focus on ... well, domain modeling. Books about database-centric design probably tell you to do database-centric design. So at that point I am not sure what I am arguing about at all, nonetheless I have to scratch that itch.</p>
<h2>How design should be done</h2>
<p>Critisizing is cheap, what's a better advice then? My answer:</p>
<p>Let the <em>more important</em> things guide the design of the system.</p>
<p>In most projects I worked on, I perceived the domains as rather simple, compared to the technical complexity that had to be managed. So it was rarely more challenging to understand the domain than it was to handle the implementation.</p>
<p>That might partially be because of the microservices trend of the last decade. Because in distributed services and especially microservice environments, there are already lots of boundaries created that more or less isolate subdomains, which by definition makes those domains rather small. And no, you dont strictly need DDD to get at that point. Subdomains or boundaries can also naturally emerge and they can also be a good fit. Other people might make different experiences, but my point still stands.</p>
<p>What I noticed is that the focus on the domain is driven by the non-developers. That's fine, but you know who has to maintain and advance the projects, the actual code? The developers. So the developers should be the ones deciding what element should be the dominating one. Yet, in the environments I worked which found this domain-focused approach, it became a sakrileg to question it. And that's wrong.</p>
<h2>Irrelevant claim: In the paper based system is no database</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>After all, in a real-world, paper based system, there is no database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct. And in which scenario is this claim relevant? Right, in a paper based system. In a paper based system, there is also no screen, but nonetheless when we're talking about software projects, we're talking about a screen where the stuff gets displayed, yes? And in a paper based system there is also no remote execution, but when doing web apps, there's certainly a network between client and server. Pretending we don't need to care about those crucial elements because they are irrelevant in some other, non-relatable context is just weird and inappropriate.</p>
<p>Furthermore. In a paper based system there might not be a database, but there is certainly <strong>persistence</strong>. Because the paper where stuff is written on is the persistence. Has anyone ever talked about the non-functional requirements of paper as a persistence? (I am sure people have). We don't, because everyone involved - developers as well as domain experts - know how paper works. Which is not the case for a database. We could do the experiment and talk about durability. If everyone is happy with using paper as persistence, what would people do when the requirement is raised that the information needs to be recoverable 20 years long and stored securely somewhere? Who is going to do that?</p>
<p>It's easy to assume things, it's easy to compare things, yet this approach falls short quickly. Just as domain experts surely expect a computer system to somehow persist data that was put in. So there <strong>is</strong> a database, because that's a reasonable common tool to achieve persistence, which is surely implicitly required by everyone without saying it. Whether it will be a file stored on disk or an actual database is an implementation detail, sure. But then again, it would be better to design and implement every single usecase based on the actual implementation detail from the start, because then it will immediately become clear when the implementation is insufficient.</p>
<h2>False: Users don't care</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The users do not care about how data is persisted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh they do. They care about the characteristics of how stuff is persisted. They have an expectation about how long and how fast it is persisted. They have an opinion about how they can access already persisted data. Most of the time those functional requirements are implicit and nobody talks about it. That doesn't make it non-existent, it only makes it harder to talk about it.</p>
<h2>Maybe: You often end up distorting the design to fit a database model</h2>
<p>Well, <strong>distorting</strong> is a tautology, it's a negative word. It could as well be <strong>guide</strong> or <strong>steer</strong>. Your database model could guide the design of the system.</p>
<p>I would say that either case is too one-sided. When a usecase is on the table, the usecase drives the design. Your database as well as any other part is just part of implementing that usecase. In most projects the database and the evolution of the database has been a much havier concern than the few classes that model the domain.</p>
<p>Let's talk about constraints. When your domain defines some states, those should be ensured somewhere, not? When you do it in some isolated classes only, than that particular encoding of the domain is fine. And then you need to persist stuff. Since you already have valid domain models, the persisted data is also valid. And now you make a change to the domain implementation and the validation changes. New stuff works. But what about the old data? Well, it's now invalid. And your persistence also doesn't validate it, so it needs to be migrated. That migration is done in ... in the persistence. So now out of a sudden the persistence get important, does it? A lot of times the validation ends up to be in the database, as well as in the domain code.</p>
<p>Or let's talk about structure. Let's say your code encodes the domain with 3 main entities. And now things change and you change the code and now it has 5 main entities. In your code, quite simple. Adjusting the persistence and existing data? Not so much.</p>
<p>What I want to say: One cannot go without the other. They are <strong>coupled</strong> one or the other way around. Pretending they are not just doesn't help, because from my point of view it decouples things that live together and rely on each other, influence each other. I reminds me of the times where databases and schemas were created and operated by different people then the developers. I don't think that was a good approach.</p>
<h2>Why persistence is hard</h2>
<p>I briefly mentioned it in the past when I wrote about boundaries and especially testing at the boundaries: Persistence is a boundary between the past and now. It's natural that changes around a boundary are harder to apply, that's inherent for a boundary. Running stateless workloads in Kubernetes is so much easier than running stateful ones, eg databases. Ever wondered why? Because you cannot freely recreate it at your will. It's inevitable.</p>
<p>Additionally. Persistence has many forms and characteristics. Most of the characteristics are somehow implicit and &quot;nobody needs to care about it&quot;. Yet everyone expects data migrations to be supported. And accessing lots of data out of a sudden must happen in miliseconds.</p>
<p>I was in a project once which was a greenfield project. Team sat together and did a rough sketch what the service should look like. It was clear persistence is needed. One colleague clearly came from the &quot;keep it simple stupid&quot; direction, which normally is <strong>my job</strong> :P. But I didn't like the situation much. He proposed to use file system and persist to files. Cant get much simpler than that, true. A debate started, one colleague asked how we could do migration of data formats with stored files. The debate got a bit heated because some people claimed that it's not clear that we need migrations at all, hence we should not prepare for it.</p>
<p>After all I don't like to pick a side on that, because there are valuable ideas on both sides. But the point is that simply using Postgres as our paved path would have taken minutes to setup, ops knew it and it supported literally every usecase you could come up with. Rendering the whole discussion close to worthless, because it took longer than just implementing it with a database and be happy.</p>
<h2>Closing words</h2>
<p>Well. Have I been able to make any reasonable point why persistence is always more of a dominating factor then we admit? I don't know. What I can say for sure: My experience told me it is. And I am not just accepting it without questioning it just to stick to a mindset that was the status quo at a time I was not even doing software development. Maybe I am repeating the mistakes of the past. Yet, I cannot help it. Am I sometimes underestimating domains? Sure. Bet I am not the only one. And it's something that I experienced as very easy to correct in hindsight as well. Am I sometimes over-focusing on persistence? I bet. All in all, my conclusion could only be that we need <strong>both</strong> sides and try to objectively determine which side should be the dominating one based on how hard it is to handle it.</p>
<p>Having that said, the above mentioned and cited book is pehnomenal. And functional domain modeling is phenomenal and I will write about that topic soon! Sadly, I cannot tell that I have been able to use that approach in production projects (not really and long enough at least). And that very thing could be the missing bit for me: That the approach of modeling the domain is so much better and causes so much goodness that I can conclude it's the right way to go. So long for now.</p>
