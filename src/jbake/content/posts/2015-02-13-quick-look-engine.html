    I just want to share a small screenshot of my OpenGL rendering project. Includes physical based rendering, a global illumination concept daveloped by myself and realtime (glossy) reflections as you can see on the screenshot. Realtime of course - seen on my GTX 770 in full hd at max 300 fps.</div>
